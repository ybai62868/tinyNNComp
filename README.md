# tinyNNComp: Build Your Own Neural Network Compiler in xxx Lines
## What is it for
As explained in the goal of [TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm),
it is important to understand tvm by constructing a tiny neural network compiler based on it.

- Course Material for teaching DL compiler. TinyNNComp can be used to teach students the concepts in deep learning systems.
  - e.g. design concepts on ISA scheduling, memory allocation, operator fusion.
- Test bed on common reusable modules for DL system. tinyNNComp, together with other systems(e.g. ONNX) can be used as testbed on the
  common reusable modules in deep learning to encourage front-end, optimization module and backends
  that are shared across frameworks.
- Just for fun :)
